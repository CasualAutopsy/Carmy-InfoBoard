# InfoBoard Sidebar (SillyTavern Extension)

A lightweight, immersive **roleplay HUD** for SillyTavern.

InfoBoard Sidebar extracts a structured `<info_board>` from the model’s replies and displays it as a clean, narrative-focused sidebar instead of cluttering the chat.  
Designed for **story-driven RP**, not stats or DnD.

## ✨ Features

- Visual sidebar for RP state (“Current State” HUD)
- Sections instead of raw lists:
  - Presence
  - Mind
  - Connection
  - World
- Mood chips
- Arousal progress bar
- Per-character state caching (switch characters, state persists)
- Optional: hide the InfoBoard block from chat (suggested)
- Optional: auto-inject InfoBoard prompt (no preset editing required)
- Mobile-safe layout (avoids bottom UI overlap)

Everything runs **locally in your browser**. No external requests.

## ⚙️ Usage

- The sidebar appears on the right as **Current State**
- Click `≡` to toggle visibility
- Use the `⋯` menu to:
  - Hide the InfoBoard from chat
  - Strip `[brackets]` in sidebar (not suggested as it might interfere with date)
  - Enable **Auto-inject InfoBoard prompt**

---

### Auto-inject prompt

When enabled, the extension automatically adds the InfoBoard instruction to outgoing generations, so you **don’t need to edit presets**. Th,s is suggested as in the current status, extension might not be suitable for all InfoBoard prompts.

## 🧠 How it works (short version)

- The model outputs an `<info_board>` inside a codeblock
- The extension:
  - Finds the latest valid InfoBoard
  - Parses key/value lines
  - Displays them in the sidebar
  - Caches the state per character
- Prompt injection (if enabled) is done by intercepting the outgoing request **locally**

## 📱 Mobile support

The panel respects:
- dynamic viewport height (`dvh`)
- safe-area insets (Android / iOS)
- bottom UI bars

You can scroll the full board without it being hidden.

## ⚠️ Notes

- This is a **third-party extension**
- SillyTavern does **not** auto-update it, I will. So I'm open to suggestions and feedbacks
